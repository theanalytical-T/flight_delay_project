# flight_delay_project
Have you ever been curious as to how many flight delays an airline or airport has within a year? This data set contains a list of airports, airlines, and metrics such as different categories in delays from 2015. A few insights I've found include:
- Which airport and airline experienced the most delays
- What was the main cause of these delays
- Cancellations based off the day of the week

Feel free to explore this data set to see what you can find!
